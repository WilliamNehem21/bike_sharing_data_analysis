# **Descriptive Analysis of Bike Sharing Data 🚴‍♀️**

## **Project Overview**

Welcome to our deep dive into bike-sharing data! This project takes a closer look at bike rental patterns in Washington D.C., aiming to uncover interesting trends and insights that can help enhance bike-sharing services. By analyzing this real-world data, we aim to provide actionable insights that can boost user engagement and optimize business strategies.

## **About the Data**

We're working with two datasets:

- **`day.csv`**: Contains daily aggregated bike rental data, ideal for spotting long-term trends.
- **`hour.csv`**: Provides hourly bike rental data, perfect for analyzing daily fluctuations and peak times.

## **Project Goals**

1. **Spot Rental Trends**: Identify the most popular rental times and understand why they occur.
2. **Seasonal and Weather Impact**: Discover how seasons and weather conditions affect bike rental patterns.
3. **User Type Insights**: Differentiate between registered and casual users to better target marketing efforts.
4. **Factor Correlations**: Determine which factors most influence bike rentals to guide business decisions.

## **Exciting Insights We Discovered**

- **Seasonal Patterns**: Bike rentals peak in autumn and summer but decrease in winter. 🍁🚴‍♀️
  
- **Weather's Role**: Clear, sunny days see more bike rentals than foggy days. People prefer biking in pleasant weather! ☀️
  
- **Registered Users Lead**: Registered users account for the majority of rentals. Building a loyal user base is essential for sustained growth. 📈

- **Temperature's Influence**: While adjusted temperature (`atemp`) shows some correlation with bike rentals, other factors may be more significant.

- **Yearly User Trends**: The mix of registered and casual users changes over time, indicating that marketing strategies need to adapt to shifting behaviors. 🔄

## **How We Did It**

- **Excel**: Used for data analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualization creation.
- **Tableau**: Created interactive visualizations to reveal hidden patterns and trends.

## **Key Visualizations**

- **Monthly Rental Trends**: Graphs showcasing rental patterns across months in 2011 and 2012.
- **Seasonal Usage Distribution**: Pie charts illustrating rental distribution by season.
- **Weather Impact Visualization**: Graphs comparing bike rentals on clear vs. foggy days.
- **User Breakdown**: A pie chart highlighting the difference between registered and casual users.

## **Key Hypotheses Tested**

1. **Monthly Usage Trends**: Analyzed whether bike rentals increase during specific months.
   
2. **Seasonal Influence**: Examined if different seasons significantly affect rental numbers.

3. **Weather Impact**: Evaluated the effect of weather conditions on bike rentals.

4. **User Type Dominance**: Assessed whether registered users make up the bulk of rentals compared to casual users.

5. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated which attributes correlate most strongly with total bike rentals.

6. **Yearly User Dependency**: Explored if the distribution of user types changes yearly.

## **Conclusion and Recommendations**

- **Boost Winter Rentals**: Consider promotions or discounts during winter to encourage more rentals. ❄️
- **Weather-Based Offers**: Implement pricing strategies that adapt to weather conditions to maximize rentals.
- **Loyalty Programs**: Focus on converting casual users into registered users to drive consistent usage.

## **Project Impact**

This analysis provides valuable insights that can guide bike-sharing companies in refining their marketing strategies and improving customer satisfaction. By understanding user behavior and external influences, businesses can better tailor their services to meet customer needs.
